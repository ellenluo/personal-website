        <p class="block-text">Hi, I'm Ellen Luo, a software developer born and raised in London, Canada. I am currently
            a
            18-year-old student majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. Computer science
            and design are two of my greatest passions, and I love channeling my enthusiasm for both through personal
            projects. I love to learn new things and am always eager to accept constructive criticism and new ideas.</p>
        <p class="left-text">I'm proficient in Java, and can apply it to build Android apps (Java/XML/SQLite), as well
            as GUI apps using Java Swing. I am also familiar with both HTML and CSS, and have recently begun to learn
            Javascript and JQuery. I'm comfortable using design and development software such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe
            Flash, Intellij Idea, Android Studio and WebStorm, and am always on the lookout to pick up new skills.</p>
        <p class="left-text">Aside from programming, I love drawing and painting both digitally and traditionally, and
            play various instruments, including the piano, clarinet and (electric and acoustic) guitar. Athletics-wise,
            I play soccer with friends during the summer, and snowboard down slopes up North during the winter.</p>
